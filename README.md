## Introduction
**Entity Enlight** is a text extraction and entity recognition tool that processes text from various sources including website URLs, PDFs, and user inputs. The application extracts the text, generates a summary, and identifies related entities, classifying them into categories such as people, organizations, locations, and more. This is achieved using an interactive interface built with Streamlit.

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Supports extracting text from website URLs, PDF files, and user-provided input.
- **Entity Recognition**: Automatically identifies and categorizes entities such as names, places, dates, and organizations.
- **Summary Generation**: Provides a concise summary of the extracted text.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Intuitive interface for uploading files, entering URLs, or typing text directly.
